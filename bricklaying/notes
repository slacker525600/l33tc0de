rows of bricks 
size 2 or 3 
each layer can't line up brick boundaries 
how many variations can there be for a given sized grid to fill 

obviously the edge lines up, 
length 2 rows regardless of hieght only one answer 
length 3 rows regardless of heigh only 1 answer 
length 4 1 row 1 answer 
length 4 2+ even number 0 answers 
length 5 2 answers regardless of height 
length 6 height 1 2 answers regardless of height 
length 7 gets interesting? 

2 2 3 
3 2 2
2 3 2

left side needs to be 2->3->2->3 
and right side needs to be either 2-3-2-3 or 3-2-3-2 

but really need to generate number of options starting and ending with each combination 
each will have a binary list of blocks spaces 
need  to and those lists and confirm all 0 
breakdown into 4 groups up front is the optimization knowing that end locations will be set by above to be different 
not clear the optimization helps but informs the challenge
